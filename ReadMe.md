Open source 2D platformer game project initially started as a uni homework project.
Note that the code needs quite some optimization, most possibly a complete rewrite, this is to be expected with a C++ port of the project for various reasons.
Also note that the physics engine is downright awful, but this creates a perfect opportunity for really fun speedruns.
Huge thatnks to @scrapigator for the awesome textures.
